description: Thoughts on Luca Guadagnino's "Call Me by Your Name"
---

One of the great miracles of cinema is its unique ability to convey the invisible stances that people hold toward one another in life. By "stances," I mean to refer to the unconscious perceptions, the ineffable mutualities, that color the air between two people the moment they engage in a relationship of any kind. 

It’s my belief that these stances emerge from the fact that we’re all, in a sense, "trapped" in our own private minds. By listening to other people speak and observing how they behave, we attempt to "know" them, but we never really can. The best we can do is try. That people do this -- that they <em>try</em> to form relationships with one another in spite of the unfathomable bridges that exists between their inner lives -- is a constant source of inspiration to me. 

And it moves me when I witness a film that, through the mysteries of filmmaking, is able to conjure this kind of courageous “stance” between two people.
